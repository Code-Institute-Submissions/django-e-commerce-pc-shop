### Design Choices

After finishing the home page and using only the bootstrap color for the page,
I was not satisfied with the look and feel that the page leaves on me as a developer,
so I found inspiration in [this](https://uxplanet.org/top-ui-ux-design-inspiration-138-90703cf88472 ) article 
and the idea of ​​how to continue in [this](https://codepen.io/aybukeceylan/pen/OJRNbZp) codepen 
from which I extracted App color, main color with shadows and white as a background for texts and images.
The site uses pronounced rounded edges, white backgrounds and shadows to get a clean and light look.
The design of this site is simple but catchy. It ensures that the products are well represented,
call to action buttons have consistency and it is easy to read and navigate as a whole.

#### Colors

- Main Site Colors
    - ![Tech Cloud Main Colors](readme_files/img/Tech-Cloud-Main-Colors.png)

#### Typography

- Logo Font
    - I chose [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) for the logo font because of the pixalization and it fits well with the theme of the page.

- Main Font
    - [Noto Sans JP](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) chosen for the readability of the text especially on smaller screens.

#### Icons

- The icons used in this project are provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

- All icons used were chosen for their obvious meaning and purpose so that they can be understood by everyone.

#### Wireframes

- These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope Plane part of the design and planning process for this project.
