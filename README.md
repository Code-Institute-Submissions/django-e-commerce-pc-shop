#### Design Choices

After finishing the home page and using only the bootstrap color for the page,
I was not satisfied with the look and feel that the page leaves on me as a developer,
so I found inspiration in THIS article and the idea of ​​how to continue in THIS codepen 
from which I extracted App color, main color with shadows and white as a background for texts and images.
The site uses pronounced rounded edges, white backgrounds and shadows to get a clean and light look.
The design of this site is simple but catchy. It ensures that the products are well represented,
call to action buttons have consistency and it is easy to read and navigate as a whole.

#### Typography

- Logo Font
    - I chose [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) for the logo font because of the pixalization and it fits well with the theme of the page.

- Main Font
