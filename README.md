#### Design Choices

After finishing the home page and using only the bootstrap color for the page,
I was not satisfied with the look and feel that the page leaves on me as a developer,
so I found inspiration in THIS article and the idea of ​​how to continue in THIS codepen 
from which I extracted App color, main color with shadows and white as a background for texts and images.
The site uses pronounced rounded edges, white backgrounds and shadows to get a clean and light look.
The design of this site is simple but catchy. It ensures that the products are well represented,
call to action buttons have consistency and it is easy to read and navigate as a whole.

#### Colors

- Main Site Colors
    - ![Tech Cloud Main Colors](readme_files/img/Tech-Cloud-Main-Colors.png)

- Helping bootstrap colors
    - ![Bootstrap Colors](readme_files/img/Bootstrap-Colors.png)

#### Typography

- Logo Font
    - I chose [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) for the logo font because of the pixalization and it fits well with the theme of the page.

- Main Font
    - [Noto Sans JP](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) chosen for the readability of the text especially on smaller screens.

#### Icons

- The icons used in this project are provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

- All icons used were chosen for their obvious meaning and purpose so that they can be understood by everyone.

#### Wireframes

- These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope Plane part of the design and planning process for this project.

- Wireframes for this project can be found [here](readme_files/wireframes/wireframes.pdf).

    - You need create **Super User**
        - In console type **python3 manage.py createsuperuser** press Enter
        - Enter **YOUR_HEROKU_ADMIN_USERNAME**
        - Enter **YOUR_HEROKU_EMAIL_ADDRESS**
        - Enter **YOUR_HEROKU_ADMIN_PASSWORD**
        - Re-enter **YOUR_HEROKU_ADMIN_PASSWORD**
        
    - To Use both databases 
        - **sqlite3 default django** database in your IDE 
        - and **Heroku Postgress** on Heroku 

    - Find **Heroku Postgress** database code

    - This code / delete it
        -  **DATABASES = {**
                **'default': dj_database_url.parse('YOUR_DATABASE_URL')**
           **}** 

    - On Same spot Paste This code

    -   `if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
            DATABASES = {
                'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
            }
        else:
            DATABASES = {
                'default': {
                    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                    'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
                }
            }`
    
    - Now You need to login to heroku and temporarily disable collectstatic
      so that **Heroku** won try to collect static files when you deploy.

      - Login to **Heroku** using **console**
                - Type **heroku login -i** in console
                - Enter **YOUR_HEROKU_EMAIL_ADDRESS**
                - Enter **YOUR_HEROKU_PASSWORD**
                - Type **heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app YOUR_HEROUKU_APP_NAME** in console
    
    - Now you need add the hostname of your **Heroku** app to **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in tech_cloud folder **settings.py**

    - Open **setting.py** and on top find this line of code
        - **ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['tech-cloud-e-shop.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']**
        - Replace that code with this one
        - **ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']**
    
    - Now you need to save your configuration on your Local storage(Github)
      and push code to Remote Storage (Heroku)

    - Because you Tested email on top your EMAIL_VARIABLES are Exposed and will be pushed to GitHub

    - Find this code in setting.py and delete it

        -   **EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'**
            **EMAIL_USE_TLS = True**
            **EMAIL_PORT = 587**
            **EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'**
            **EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'YOUR_HOST_EMAIL'**
            **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD'**

    - Copy and Paste this Code on same spot

        -   **if 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ:**
                **EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'**
                **DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'techcloud@example.com'**
            **else:**
                **EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'**
                **EMAIL_USE_TLS = True**
                **EMAIL_PORT = 587**
                **EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'**
                **EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')**
                **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')**
                **DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')**

    - Now you can try to deploy to Heroku
        - Type in Console **git add .**
        - Type in Console **git commit -m "Deployment"**
        - First push to **Github**
            - Type in Console **git push**
        - Now try to push to **Heroku**
            - Type in Console **git push heroku master**
        - You may need to initialize your **heroku git remote** 
            - Type in Console **heroku git:remote -a YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME**
            - And try again
                - Type in Console **git push heroku master**

    - Code is now on Heroku if you try to run apliccation now is not be pretty
      because you disable collection of static files which will host on **Amazon Aws S3**

        - and **YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**
        - you will need this keys when connectihg **Heroku** with your static files and media files.
    
   - Now go back to your **Gitpod** 

   - And find this code in tech_cloud **setting.py**

        -  **# Bucket Config**
            **AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'tech-cloud-e-shop'**
            **AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'**

        - Click **Add**
        - Find Variable **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** - **1** and delete it.
        - You don't need that variable any more.

    - At this point, there are a few little things left to finish so that your project can be 
      completely deployed on Herok and that you can use AWS S3 as a bucket for static files and media files.

    - First **Deploy to Heroku**
        - Because you **Enable Automatic Deploy** on **Heroku**
          you just need to add, commit and pust to your **GitHub** rest will be automatic.

            - Type in Console **git push**

        - Now your application is deploying on **Heroku**
            - It will collect all **Static Files**
                - Because you deleted **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** from **Heroku** **Config Vars**
            - Will send **static** files to **AWS S3 Bucket** 
                - Because last time when you added variable in **Heroku** 
                  you set variable **USE_AWS** to **True** 
                - and you set **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**
                  so that your **Heroku** Aplication have access to **Aws S3 Bucket**

        - Go to **Heroku** 
        - From Menu tab select **Activity**
          and if your app is building properly you will
          see a link to the build log at the top of the **Activity** tab.

            - Under **VALUE** enter **YOUR_HEROKU_APP_STRIPE_WH_SECRET**
                - To get **YOUR_HEROKU_APP_STRIPE_WH_SECRET**
                - You need create new **Stripe end point** for **Heroku app**
                - Last one was for **Gitpod**
                    - Go to your **Stripe** account
                    - From left menu select **Developers** and then **Webhooks**

                    - On **Signing secret** click on **Click to reveal**
                    - This **Signing secret** key is **YOUR_HEROKU_APP_STRIPE_WH_SECRET**
            - Go back to **Heroku** and paste **YOUR_HEROKU_APP_STRIPE_WH_SECRET** under value for **STRIPE_WH_SECRET**
            - Click **Add**
    
    - Last thing to do verify **YOUR_HEROKU_ADMIN_USER** for **Heroku Django Administration**
        - Go to **Heroku**
        - On **Personal** menu 
        - Click on **YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME**
